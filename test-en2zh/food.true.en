flavor : organic irish breakfast
&#124;
size : 8 ounce
the cold and rainy weather and hardened persona made a strong morning brew a perfect fit for ireland
while having existed for centuries , there is no exact formula for loose irish breakfast tea , rather it is a blend of assorted teas
u.s
wellness uses two distinct estates that , due to their varied altitudes , have various taste pallets in different tea gardens on their property
both of these black tea estates are located in sri lanka , a country that was once called ceylon , and has passed that recognizable name onto a type of tea drunk today
located just off the southern tip of india , sri lanka is small , about the size of west virginia
surprisingly , given its land mass , it is one of the largest tea producers in the world , and tea is its largest industry
this blend of irish breakfast tea uses all 100 % organic ceylon tea
ceylon is the general classification name given to loose black teas that are grown and cultivated in sri lanka
one of the contributing factors to the prominence of tea in sri lanka is their unique production method
they made their name in tea through meticulous workmanship , using the orthodox method to produce all of their teas
methods such as ctc manufacturing are no doubt faster , but the sri lankans have pride in their work , and have stood by the slower but delicate orthodoxy
